                Saylani Mass IT Training Program. To Train 10 Thousand Developers in Pakistan

                Living in an era driven by information technology makes investing in our youth through computer programing education necessary. Our vision is to make Pakistan a Global Software Development Hub with the brightest IT minds. We want to empower our youth to think, create and change the software world. To achieve this goal, Saylani launched its Saylani Mass I.T (SMIT) Program. SMIT offers expert training in the areas of Mobile and web application development, CCNA, graphic designing, computer based accountancy etc. With about 4,000 students currently enrolled with SMIT at Karachi and Faisalabad, we aim to produce a total of 10,000 skilled software developers on a national level. Not only will this generate numerous jobs but will also inadvertently boost our annual GDP by 1 billion dollars.
                
                We have collaborated with world-renowned organizations for SMIT that include Microsoft, CISCO, SDC, Viftech and City Guild UK.
